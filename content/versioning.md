## Versioning

We use a version string specified in the base URL that can be incremented independently from older APIs.
Using the newest available API is always encouraged.

The current version is **v2**.

These changes are considered backwards **compatible** and will not require the version string to be incremented:

- Adding properties to JSON objects
- Changing the number of items returned in a single listing request
- Changing rate limiting thresholds
- The structure or length of identifiers generated by the API
- Changing error messages

These changes are considered backwards **incompatible** and will require the version string to be incremented:

- Updating a property name
- Removing properties from JSON objects
- Changing an API's URL structure
